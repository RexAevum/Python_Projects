Need to install pyinstaller to be able to create an executable file

1) pyinstaller --onefile --windowed {main script name}
    a) --onefile --> will create only the executable file(.exe) without all the aditional files used in the program
    b) --windowed --> will prevent a terminal being opened once the exe file is ran

WARNING!!!
If there is a hardcoded path, that path will casue the exe file to error -> to fix this issue:
    1) Move the executable to the same folder as the main script for the program
