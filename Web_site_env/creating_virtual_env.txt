Tech used:
- virtualenv
+ script to install: pip install virtualenv

!!! Need to create a virtual enviornment before you start developing the website using a fresh copy of python !!!

To create a virtual enviornment:

1) create a super-folder for the folder containing the website
    - the virtual enviornment needs to be at the same level/depth as the website folder

2) Navigate to the folder the contains the website folder

3) Run script: "python -m venv {x}"
    - where x == folder name for virtual enviornment folder

4) Once the enviornment is set up, include the filepath "x/Scripts/" then run the script you need
    - ex --> virtual/Scripts/
    - where x == folder name for virtual enviornment folder

5) First need to install the remote libraries, just like you would on your own computer
    - ex the library used to set up the website --> PS..> virtual/Scripts/pip install flask

6) After that run the python script that serves as the main of your website with the corect folder name as the file path
    - ex --> virtual/Scripts/python Basic_personal_website/index.py
