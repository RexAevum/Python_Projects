When writing a git message, keep in mind the following
    
    !!!-> If applied, this commit will {your subject line here} <-!!!

For example:

    If applied, this commit will refactor subsystem X for readability
    If applied, this commit will update getting started documentation
    If applied, this commit will remove deprecated methods
    If applied, this commit will release version 1.0.0
    If applied, this commit will merge pull request #123 from user/branch

Notice how this doesnâ€™t work for the other non-imperative forms:

    If applied, this commit will fixed bug with Y
    If applied, this commit will changing behavior of X
    If applied, this commit will more fixes for broken stuff
    If applied, this commit will sweet new API methods
